# Topic-Modelling-of-Pompeian-Wall-Inscriptions
Computational Literacy course, autumn 2024


Project Overview

This is the final project for the Computational Literacy course (Autumn 2024). In this project, I explore the themes represented on Pompeii's wall inscriptions using computational methods, specifically Voyant Tools and Palladio. The Pompeian wall inscriptions provide a unique lens into the lives and cultural expressions of ancient Pompeii, documenting personal, social, and public interactions in a way that literary texts of the time could not. The goal of this project is to identify prevalent themes within this dataset and understand how they reflect the daily lives of Pompeii's inhabitants.


Data Files

edcs_raw_data.txt: Contains the raw data of Pompeian inscriptions extracted from the Epigraphik-Datenbank Clauss/Slaby (https://objects.auxiliary.idai.world/Tei-Viewer/cgi-bin/teiviewer.php?manifest=BOOK-ZID881596).

lemmatized_text.txt: The raw text after lemmatization using Collatinus (https://outils.biblissima.fr/en/collatinus/).

roman_names.txt: A list of Roman nomina and cognomina used to filter out proper names from the dataset (from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_nomina  and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_cognomina).


Code Files

The following Python scripts were used to process and clean the data:

cleaning_raw_data.py: Cleans the raw data by removing metadata and irrelevant information.

cleaning_lemma.py: Handles the lemmatization of the text and ensures only the root forms of the Latin words are retained.

cleaning_names.py: Creates and processes the list of Roman names for removal from the text.

removing_names.py: Removes proper names from the text using the list generated by cleaning_names.py.


Visualizations

Voyant Tool Output Images: Visualizations of the most common words in the corpus (https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=77fc55849d45f060a6fb14b7db4260c2&visible=25&view=Cirrus).

Palladio Table of Categories and Frequencies: A table that lists the thematic categories, corresponding words, and their frequencies within the dataset.

Excel Bar Chart of Category Occurrences: A bar chart that displays the frequency of thematic categories in the Pompeian inscriptions.


Analysis Files

Final Project (PDF): A detailed report of the analysis, methodology, and results of the project.
